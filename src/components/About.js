Agriculture is increasingly knowledge-intensive. Knowledge derived from combining data from various
sourcescan be used to derive valuable actionable insights. At the farm-level, the farmers of today have to deal
with a myriad of data to be able to make livelihood-based decisions on a regular basis. Data on soil health,
weather, irrigation, markets, early-warning systems, diseases and pests, finance/loan availability, as well as
government- related information/subsidies all come into play in planning at the farm-level. At the province or
district level, the policymaker has to have real-time or near real-time information on market prices, projected
yield of a particular crop at the end of the harvest season, beneficiaries of government schemes/subsidies,
efficacy of pre-emptive actions to protect against diseases and pests, disaster mitigation and much more. At the
national level, quality data would help design effective policies to assist smallholder farmers, monitor and
remove inefficiencies in the value- chains, assure consumers about quality produce and to eradicate hunger,
malnutrition and ensure food security in the country. Agriculture, as other fields, will have the unprecedented
capability to extract intelligence and make evidence-based decisions firmly grounded on real-time, reliable data
and effective analytics. Introduction of new actors in the value chain and investment in developing the
capacities of existing actors will be some of the key challenges that Governments will have to address. Newer
ways of harvesting data will lead to granular insights thatpreviously was impossible to achieve.
